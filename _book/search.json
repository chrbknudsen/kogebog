Transfer to a large saucepan or a flameproof casserole dish and set aside.\n\nFry the bacon in the frying pan until starting to brown and crisp and then add to the dish with the sausages.\n\nAdd the onions to the frying pan and fry over a medium heat for 5 minutes until they start to soften, stirring often. You should have enough fat in the pan, but if not, add a little more oil. Add the garlic and cook for 2–3 minutes until the onions turn pale golden brown, stirring frequently.\n\nSprinkle over the chilli powder and cook together for a few seconds longer.\n\nStir in the tomatoes, stock, tomato purée, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar and herbs. Pour in the wine, or some water if you’re not using wine, and bring to a simmer.\n\nTip the tomato mixture carefully into the pan with the sausages and bacon and return to a simmer. Reduce the heat, cover the pan loosely with a lid and leave to simmer very gently for 20 minutes, stirring from time to time.\n\nStir the beans into the casserole, and continue to cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick.\n\nSeason to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper and serve with rice or slices of rustic bread."
